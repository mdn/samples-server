mdn-samples/s
=============

This directory contains a folder for each project that needs to be available. Each one has a manifest and whatever files that service requires. Some may be simple static HTML content that isn't compatible with MDN's iframe-based built-in sample system. Others may include complex background processes or scripts that need to be run server-side.
