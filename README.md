samples-server
==============

This is a live sample server for MDN, which I hope we will be able to use to host content that only works when on a less restrictive environment than running in an iframe on Kuma.

The ''s'' directory contains a folder for each project that needs to be available. Each one has a manifest and whatever files that service requires.

The ''v'' directory is a place we can keep miscellaneous assets which may be needed by MDN content, can't be attached to MDN pages, and have no other home.
